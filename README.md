Synopsis
========
**HAXX** (**H**amilton's Quaternion **A**lgebra for C**XX**) is a C++ software
infrastructure for the development of efficient scalar and tensorial quaternion
algorithms.

Design Goals
============
* A high-level, modern C++ API for scalar quaternion algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Access to low level optimization and vectorization of the real arithmetic underlying quaternion operations
* Extension of BLAS and LAPACK functionality to quaternion algebra
* A reusable software framework to enable future scalar and tensorial algorithmic development using the quaternion algebra

Developers
==========
